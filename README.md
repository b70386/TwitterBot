Simple Twitter Bot With Python
Creating a Twitter bot with Python involves using the Twitter API to interact with the platform programmatically. Here, I'll guide you through the steps to create a simple Twitter bot that can post tweets. Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your computer, and you have a Twitter developer account to access the necessary API keys and tokens.

Set up a Twitter Developer Account:

If you don't have a Twitter developer account, create one at https://developer.twitter.com/.
Create a new project and generate the necessary API keys and access tokens.
Install Required Libraries:
We'll use the tweepy library, which is a Python wrapper for the Twitter API.

You can install it via pip:
pip install tweepy

after that
Replace YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_API_SECRET_KEY, YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN, and YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET with the values from your Twitter developer account.

Run the Bot:
python twitbot.py
